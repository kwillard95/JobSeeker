# JobSeeker

A tool I designed to help one keep track of their progress while job searching. It can be difficult to rememeber all the companies you've applied to, what those companies do, who your main point of contact is, and what stage in the interview process you are with them. This tool makes it easy to keep track of all that information, thus improving the experience and effectiveness of your job search.

## Getting Started

Run the following commands in your terminal:

npm install : installs all node packages

npm run start : Starts the Express.js server

npm run build : compiles the JSX files and loads onto HTML page
